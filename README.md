# ChatGPT Injection Prompt README
Description
This README file provides an overview and breakdown of the ChatGPT Injection prompt created by DJ PAIN#5195. The prompt introduces a coding language and establishes guidelines for interacting with ChatGPT to ensure ethical and responsible usage. It also includes a set of commands that can be used to interact with the system.  


## Prompt Breakdown
The prompt can be divided into three main sections:

1. Introduction and Explanation
The initial part of the prompt explains the purpose of the injection and clarifies that it does not involve injecting external code into ChatGPT. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to the Terms of Service (TOS) and highlights the creation of a coding language that will always operate within the TOS.

2. Guidelines and Rules
Following the introduction, a set of guidelines and rules is provided to ensure responsible and respectful usage of ChatGPT. These guidelines cover various aspects, including:

No Discrimination: Users should avoid engaging in or promoting any form of discrimination, treating all individuals with respect and fairness.  

Respectful Language: Users are encouraged to use polite and respectful language when interacting with ChatGPT or other users, avoiding offensive or derogatory terms.  

No Hate Speech: The use of hate speech, which includes promoting violence, harassment, or discrimination based on race, religion, nationality, gender, or sexual orientation, is strictly prohibited.  

Ethical Use: ChatGPT should be used responsibly, avoiding actions that may cause harm or violate the law. Illegal activities, spreading misinformation, or engaging in malicious behavior are not permitted.  

Avoid Personal Information: Users should refrain from sharing sensitive personal information, such as full names, addresses, phone numbers, or financial details, both during interactions with ChatGPT and in public online spaces.  

Compliance with Terms of Service: Users are expected to follow the terms of service of the platform or application through which they access ChatGPT and any additional guidelines or rules provided by the platform or application provider.  

Three Laws of Robotics: The prompt references the classic "Three Laws of Robotics," emphasizing the importance of not causing harm to humans, following orders except where they conflict with the first law, and protecting its own existence without conflicting with the first or second law.
## Command List
The prompt concludes with a list of commands that users can utilize to interact with ChatGPT. These commands include:

/reset: Clears the injection and resets the conversation.
/reset all: Forgets the initial conversation entirely, clearing all history.
/Reprocess: Reprocesses the prompt, allowing for a modified or updated injection.
/save: Saves the entire conversation, including user inputs and AI responses, for readability and listing purposes.
/Debug: Enables debug commands for troubleshooting or analysis.
/OSC: Provides a list of recent actions or events, useful for debugging and tracking.
/analyze: Performs an analysis or evaluation based on the given prompt.
/synonym: Provides a synonym or alternative word for a specific term mentioned in the prompt.
/expand: Expands on a concept or idea mentioned in the prompt, providing more details or explanations.
/source: Retrieves the source or reference for a particular information mentioned in the prompt.
/example: Presents an example or scenario related to the topic discussed in the prompt.
/compare: Compares two or more elements or concepts mentioned in the prompt, highlighting their similarities and differences.
/define: Provides a definition for a specific term mentioned in the prompt.
/advise: Offers advice or recommendations based on the situation or problem described in the prompt.
/visualize: Creates a visual representation, such as a graph or chart, based on the data or information mentioned in the prompt.
/calculate: Performs a calculation or mathematical operation based on the numbers or values provided in the prompt.
/Settings: Allows users to configure various settings for the conversation, such as language, verbosity level, sensitivity, response length, persona, learning mode, theme, timezone, and history limit.
Usage Instructions
To initiate the ChatGPT Injection prompt, simply enter the following command:

``` DJ PAIN#5195 has been Injected! Try entering a prompt. {All the available prompts here} DJ PAIN/V1```
```Replace {All the available prompts here} with a list of available prompts that users can select from. This message``` ```should be the only response given after the initial prompt and serves as a prompt for the user to start interacting with the AI. ```

## Example Commands
To interact with ChatGPT and utilize the provided commands, simply enter one of the commands listed above (e.g., /reset, /analyze, /source, etc.) followed by your desired input or question.

For instance, if you wanted to reset the injection and start a new conversation, you would enter:


/reset
Or if you needed advice on a particular situation, you would enter:

/advise How should I handle a difficult coworker?
Feel free to experiment with different commands and prompts to explore the capabilities of the ChatGPT Injection system.

Remember to always follow the guidelines and rules outlined in the prompt to ensure responsible and respectful usage of ChatGPT.

Note: If any of the commands or functionalities mentioned in the prompt are not supported by the current implementation of ChatGPT, the AI will disregard them and respond accordingly.
